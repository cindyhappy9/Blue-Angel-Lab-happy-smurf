Scientific exploration is a difficult process. 
It is inevitable to experience failure. Maintaining a good state of mind will not only benefit the researchers, but also contribute a good soft atmosphere to the laboratory. 
The Happy Labs program is to help researchers have a happy and strong heart, and to achieve a balance of research, family, and social responsibility.
